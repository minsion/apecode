Then after the browser initiates the request to the server for the first time and gets the request result, it will decide whether to cache the result based on the cache flag in the HTTP header of the response message. If it is, it will store the request result and cache flag in the browser cache. The simple process is as follows:</p><p><img src="https://p3-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/487144abaada4b9a8b34bc9375191ec7~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-in-crop-mark:1512:0:0:0.awebp" alt=""></p><p>From the above figure, we can know:</p><ul><li>Every time the browser initiates a request, it will first search for the result of the request and the cache flag in the browser cache;</li><li>Every time the browser gets the returned request result, it will store the result and cache flag in the browser cache.</li></ul><p>The above two conclusions are the key to the browser cache mechanism. It ensures the cache storage and reading of each request. As long as we understand the usage rules of the browser cache, all problems will be solved. For easy understanding, the cache process is divided into two parts, namely <code>forced cache</code> and <code>negotiated cache</code>, according to whether it is necessary to re-initiate HTTP request to the server.</p><h3 id="forced-cache" tabindex="-1">Forced cache <a class="header-anchor" href="#forced-cache" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Forced cache&quot;">​</a></h3><p><code>Forced cache is the process of searching the browser cache for the request result and deciding whether to use the cache result according to the cache rule of the result</code>. When the browser initiates a request to the server, the server will put the cache rule into the HTTP header of the HTTP response message and return it to the browser together with the request result. The fields that control forced cache are <code>Expires</code> and <code>Cache-Control</code>, among which Cache-Control has a higher priority than Expires.</p><p>There are three main situations of forced caching (the negotiation cache process is not analyzed for the time being), as follows:</p><ol><li><p>If the cache result and cache identifier do not exist, the forced cache is invalid, and a request is directly made to the server (consistent with the first request);</p></li><li><p>If the cache result and cache identifier exist, but the result has expired, the forced cache is invalid, and the negotiated cache is used;</p></li><li><p>If the cache result and cache identifier exist, and the result has not expired, the forced cache is effective, and the result is directly returned</p></li></ol><h3 id="negotiated-cache" tabindex="-1">Negotiated Cache <a class="header-anchor" href="#negotiated-cache" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Negotiated Cache&quot;">​</a></h3><p><code>Negotiated cache is the process in which the browser sends a request to the server with the cache identifier after the forced cache is invalid, and the server decides whether to use the cache based on the cache identifier</code>. Similarly, the negotiated cache identifier is also returned to the browser in the HTTP header of the response message together with the request result. The fields that control the negotiated cache are: Last-Modified / If-Modified-Since and Etag / If-None-Match, among which Etag / If-None-Match has a higher priority than Last-Modified / If-Modified-Since.

It is an independent unit for resource allocation and scheduling of the operating system and a carrier for application operation. Process is an abstract concept and has never had a unified standard definition.</p><p>A thread is a single sequential control flow in program execution. It is the smallest unit of program execution flow and the basic unit of processor scheduling and dispatching. A process can have one or more threads, and each thread shares the program&#39;s memory space (that is, the memory space of the process in which it is located). A standard thread consists of a thread ID, a current instruction pointer (PC), registers, and registers. and stack. A process consists of memory space (code, data, process space, open files) and one or more threads.</p><p>Coroutines, in English, is based on threads, but is &quot;lighter than threads&quot;. This lightweight thread managed by programmers writing programs is called &quot;user space thread&quot; and has the characteristic of being invisible to the kernel.</p><p>[Difference]: Scheduling: Threads are the basic unit of scheduling and allocation, and processes are the basic unit of resources; Concurrency: Not only can processes be executed concurrently, but multiple threads of the same process can also be executed concurrently; Owning resources: A process is an independent unit with resources. Threads do not own system resources, but can access resources belonging to processes. System overhead: When creating or canceling a process, the system overhead is significantly greater than the overhead of creating or canceling a thread because the system has to allocate and recycle resources for it. However, processes have independent address spaces. When a process crashes, it will not affect other processes in protected mode, while threads are just different execution paths in a process. Threads have their own stacks and local variables, but there is no separate address space between threads. If a process dies, all threads die. Therefore, multi-process programs are more robust than multi-threaded programs, but when switching processes, they consume more resources and are less efficient.</p><p>[Relationship]: A thread can only belong to one process, while a process can have multiple threads, but at least one thread; Resources are allocated to processes, and all threads of the same process share all resources of the process; Processors are allocated to threads, that is, threads actually run on processors; Threads need to cooperate and synchronize during execution. Threads of different processes should use message communication to achieve synchronization.</p>`,47),s=[o];function n(c,h,l,d,p,u){return a(),t("div",null,s)}const m=e(i,[["render",n]]);export{g as __pageData,m as default};
