The Model layer represents the data model, the View represents the UI component, and the ViewModel is the bridge between the View and Model layers. The data will be bound to the ViewModel layer and automatically rendered to the page. When the view changes, the ViewModel layer will be notified to update the data. <code>In the past, the DOM structure was operated to update the view, and now the data drives the view</code>.</p><h3 id="advantages-of-mvvm" tabindex="-1">Advantages of MVVM <a class="header-anchor" href="#advantages-of-mvvm" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Advantages of MVVM&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><code>Low coupling</code>.

Its core library is very lightweight, with clear documentation and rich examples, allowing beginners to get started quickly.</li><li><code>Progressive framework</code>: Vue.js is a progressive framework that allows you to gradually introduce different parts of it as needed, such as Vue Router, Vuex, etc. This flexibility is very useful for projects of different sizes and needs.</li><li><code>Responsive data binding</code>: Vue.js provides a powerful data binding mechanism that can easily achieve synchronous updates of views and data and improve development efficiency.</li><li><code>Componentized development</code>: Vue.js encourages the use of componentized development methods to split pages into multiple reusable components to improve the maintainability and reusability of the code.</li><li><code>Virtual DOM</code>: Vue.js uses virtual DOM technology. When data changes, it reduces real DOM operations by comparing the differences between virtual DOM and real DOM, thereby improving performance.</li><li><code>Rich documentation</code>: Vue.js official documentation is detailed and provides a large number of examples and explanations for developers to consult.</li><li><code>Active community</code>: Vue.js has a large community, and there are many third-party plug-ins and libraries that can be used to solve various problems.</li><li><code>Rich ecosystem</code>: In addition to the core library, Vue.js also has a large number of ecosystem libraries, such as Vue Router (routing), Vuex (state management), Vuetify (UI component library), etc., which can help build more complete applications.</li></ol><h3 id="disadvantages" tabindex="-1">Disadvantages <a class="header-anchor" href="#disadvantages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Disadvantages&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><code>Scale limitation</code>: Although Vue.js is suitable for most projects, for particularly large applications, it may not be powerful enough due to the lack of features of some large frameworks (such as Angular).</li><li><code>Varying plugin quality</code>: Although there are many excellent Vue.js plugins and libraries, not all of them are of high quality, and sometimes you may need to make a decision among multiple choices.</li><li><code>Relatively new</code>: Although Vue.js has been around for a while, it has a relatively short history compared to some other frameworks (such as Angular and React). This may affect some companies&#39; decisions when choosing a technology stack.</li><li><code>Global state management</code>: Although Vue.js provides Vuex for global state management, in large applications, the management of global state may require more work.</li></ol><h2 id="vue-underlying-implementation-principle" tabindex="-1">Vue underlying implementation principle <a class="header-anchor" href="#vue-underlying-implementation-principle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Vue underlying implementation principle&quot;">​</a></h2><p>vue.js adopts the method of <code>data hijacking combined with publisher-subscriber mode</code>, hijacking the setter and getter of each attribute through Object.defineProperty(), publishing messages to subscribers when data changes, triggering corresponding listening callbacks.</p><p>Vue is a typical MVVM framework.

Setters and getters can be defined inside this function. Whenever the data changes, the setter will be triggered. At this time, Observer will notify the subscriber, and the subscriber is Watcher.</p><p>Watcher (subscriber): Watcher subscribers serve as a bridge for communication between Observer and Compile.

Computed properties are used to declaratively describe that a value depends on other values. When the dependent value or variable changes, the calculated property will also change; watch monitors the variables that have been defined in data. When the variable changes, the method in watch is triggered.</p><p>watch property monitoring is an object. The key is the property to be observed, and the value is the corresponding callback function. It is mainly used to monitor changes in certain specific data, so as to perform certain specific business logic operations. Monitoring property changes is used when asynchronous or high-cost operations need to be performed when data changes.</p><p>computed computed property The result of the property will be cached. When the property that the function in computed depends on has not changed, the result will be read from the cache when the current function is called. Unless the dependent responsive property changes, it will be recalculated. It is mainly used as a property. The function in computed must use return to return the final result. computed is more efficient and should be used first. If data does not change, computed will not be updated.</p><p>Usage scenario computed: <code>Use when a property is affected by multiple properties</code>, for example: shopping cart product settlement function watch: Use when a piece of data affects multiple pieces of data, for example: search data</p><h2 id="why-is-data-in-a-component-a-function" tabindex="-1">Why is data in a component a function? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-data-in-a-component-a-function" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why is data in a component a function?&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li>If a component is reused multiple times, multiple instances will be created.

As long as data changes are detected, Vue will open a queue and buffer all data changes that occur in the same event loop.

NextTick mainly uses macrotasks and microtasks. According to the execution environment, try to use Promise, MutationObserver, and setImmediate respectively. If none of the above works, setTimeout is used to define an asynchronous method.
