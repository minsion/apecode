When the transmission frequency is high, or due to network bursts, the data packet may reach the receiver faster in a certain period of time, and the receiver may still not have time to receive it, resulting in packet sticking;</p></li><li><p>Although the third method avoids packet sticking, the efficiency of the application is low and it is not suitable for real-time applications.</p></li></ul>`,50),r=[n];function o(h,c,l,d,p,u){return s(),t("div",null,r)}const f=e(i,[["render",o]]);export{k as __pageData,f as default};
