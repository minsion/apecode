When operating on some properties, this return method cannot be intercepted, including adding new properties that are not available to the object, or deleting a certain property, or changing the array in the form of an array subscript. ViewModel cannot monitor it, and vue.$ needs to be called. The set() method then changes the responsive data.</li><li>vue3 uses the proxy proxy proposed by ES6. It is equivalent to built-in executors such as set and delete. It proxies the entire object instead of the properties of the object.

Although it is simple and intuitive, it is not effective when dealing with complex and large-scale node changes. , the performance is not as good as Vue 3.</li><li>Vue 3 adopts an optimization algorithm based on <code>single-ended comparison and LIS</code> (based on bit operations, marking the beginning and end, and then comparing from the middle, using bit operations to reduce the number of judgments), which significantly improves the performance and performance of the diff process. Efficiency, especially when handling large-scale and complex node changes, is better. At the same time, unnecessary comparisons and DOM operations are further reduced through compile-time optimizations such as static promotion and Block Tree.</li></ul><h2 id="refer-to" tabindex="-1">refer to <a class="header-anchor" href="#refer-to" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;refer to&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p><a href="https://juejin.cn/post/7205504065504477243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">What optimizations has vue3 done compared to vue2 - Don‚Äôt lose 20 pounds and don‚Äôt change your avatar üìù</a></p>',12),r=[n];function s(d,c,p,h,l,m){return t(),o("div",null,r)}const g=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
